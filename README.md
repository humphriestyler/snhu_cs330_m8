SNHU CS330 OpenGL 3D Scene

** I was unable to upload my entire scene with the .sln, .vcxproj.filters, .vcxproj.user, and .vcxproj files as it was too large for GitHub, but I uploaded all the code, textures, and library dependencies **

1. How do I approach designing software?
I designed my project in a milestone format. I chose all the 3D elements I needed and created a workflow and timeline on when to complete them. While it's not entirely the same, it was similar to a SCRUM setup. On Monday - Tuesday, I molded the ship into its proper shape and included buildings into the plane. On Wednesday - Thursday, I added the mountains but didn't put them in order just yet. On Friday - Saturday, I placed the mountains and ship into their proper position and rearranged the UV values to make sure the lighting was displayed properly. On Sunday, I reviewed the project and made some finishing touches before submitting it. This method allowed me to get everything done on time, without the feeling of a stressful time crunch.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
I really liked the approach CS-330 took for building on to our final project each week. Unlike some classes, we didn't learn all of the material and then had a week to complete our project. I feel this would have added more stress and urgency, which would have led to mistakes. Instead, I really liked how each week we were instructed to add small elements to our final project, such as lighting and texture, so we had a basic framework completed by Module 7.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I really enjoy using code to build new projects, and especially learning new things in the computer science field. CS-330 was certainly the toughest class I've taken yet, and it really showed me that if I can put my mind to it and I'm determined, I can overcome any hurdles that I encounter. I entered this class worried about the horror stories of how difficult this class could be, and I exited the class confident and proud that I made it through. This course has surely given me more tools and skills ranging from OpenGL programming to problem-solving techniques. One lesson I think I will surely take with me is structuring my project in a way so that not everything is contained in the Main.cpp file, leaving the project clean, organized, and easy to understand.
